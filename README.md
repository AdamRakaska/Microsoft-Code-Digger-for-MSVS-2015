# Microsoft Code Digger
A Visual Studio Extension

Now resurected and available for these Visual Studio versions:
Visual Studio 2013
Visual Studio 2015

I loved this Visual Studio extension, and was bummed when it wasnt available for 2015. Well, I was able to successfully modify the VSIX file to trick it into installing on VS 2013 and 2015. Possibly even 2017, upon request.

Enjoy!
