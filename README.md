A Visual Studio Extension

Now resurected and available for these Visual Studio versions:
* Visual Studio 2013
* Visual Studio 2015
* Visual Studio 2017

I loved this Visual Studio extension, and was bummed when it wasnt available for 2015. Well, I was able to successfully modify the VSIX file to trick it into installing on VS 2013, 2015 and now even 2017!

Enjoy!
