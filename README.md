A Visual Studio Extension

Now resurected and available for these Visual Studio versions:
* Visual Studio 2013
* Visual Studio 2015
* Visual Studio 2017
* Visual Studio 2019

And these editions:
* Community
* Professional
* Enterprise


I loved this Visual Studio extension, and was bummed when it wasnt available for 2015.
Determined to make Pex work once again, I opened the .VSIX file in 7zip and modified the extension.vsixmanifest to accept later versions of Visual Studio, and it worked! There were no fundamental dependency or compatability issues.

I have personally tested and used this extension in the following Visual Studio versions: 2013, 2015, 2017 and now even 2019!

Note: 2019 will warn you that the plugin is deprecated, and ask you if you want to disable it. Just tell it to continue on or not warn you again and it still functions.

Enjoy!
